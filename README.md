I developed a Smart Irrigation System with Arduino to maximise water use and keep
the perfect soil moisture levels. The project's main goals were to automate
irrigation, save water and monitor soil moisture levels in real-time. The system
controlled a water pump to supply water to the plants only when the soil moisture
fell below a predefined threshold. This strategy prevented overwatering while
ensuring that plants received a proper amount of water
